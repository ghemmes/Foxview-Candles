# Foxview Candles
Foview Candles will be a ecommerce website for a local candle business.

# Issues
First, this website is a work in progress and not production-ready. Additionally, the first fork of this project had Firebase deployment issues. Due to that, and not git-ignoring my env file, I created a new repository. This repository only reflects the most recent changes I have made. This repository was private due to incompleteness, but I've made it public to show what else I'm currently working on
